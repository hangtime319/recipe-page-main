# Recipe Page

A responsive, single-page recipe website with a clean, modern design.

## Description

This project is a solution to the "Recipe page" challenge from Frontend Mentor. The main objective was to create a clean, static page to display a recipe. This project is an excellent demonstration of foundational skills in web development, as it uses **semantic HTML** to structure the content logically and **CSS** to create a responsive, readable layout without the use of any JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For creating the semantic structure of the page, including elements like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and lists to organize the ingredients and instructions.
* **CSS3:** This is the sole technology for all the styling. It was used to create the responsive layout, handle typography, colors, and ensure the page is easy to read on all devices.
* **JavaScript:** This is a purely static project. No JavaScript was required for any functionality.
